# Word Chart 
This is a Word chart MOD for TIBCO Spotfire.

## Prerequisites
These instructions assume that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which includes npm) installed.

## How to get started (with development server)
- Open a terminal at the location of this example.
- Run `npm install`. This will install necessary tools. Run this command only the first time you are building the mod and skip this step for any subsequent builds.
- Run `npm start`. This will bundle the JavaScript and place it in the `dist` folder. This task will watch for changes in the code and will continue running until it is stopped. Whenever you save a file, the changes will be reflected in the visualization mod.
- Run `npm run server` in a separate terminal. This will start a development server.
- Start editing, for example `src/index.js`.
- In Spotfire, follow the steps of creating a new mod and connecting to the development server.

## Working without a development server
- Open a terminal at the location of this example.
- Run `npm install`. This will install necessary tools. Run this command only the first time you are building the mod and skip this step for any subsequent builds.
- Run `npm run build`. This will bundle the JavaScript and place it in the `dist` folder. It also copies the contents of `static` into `dist`. This task will not watch for changes in the code.
- In Spotfire, follow the steps of creating a new mod and then browse for, and point to, the _manifest_ in the `dist` folder.
